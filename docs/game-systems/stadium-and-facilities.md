# Stadium & Facilities

> **Status:** Long-term vision. Phase 1 is the first implementable slice; later phases are directional and will be refined when we get to them.

The club's physical infrastructure, matchday operation, fan base, and commercial portfolio — modelled as a living system rather than the static economic backdrop it is today.

## Purpose

Turn four static inputs (fixed seat count, reputation-indexed matchday rate, lump-sum commercial revenue, monolithic facilities tier) into an interacting system of decisions and slow-moving stats. Its core design goal is a legible **"on-pitch success → off-pitch money → squad power → on-pitch success"** flywheel, with memorable payoff events (sold-out derby, kit-deal activation bonus, naming-rights renewal) replacing invisible annual arithmetic.

## Design Principles

1. **One flywheel, legible payoff.** Every lever connects visibly to recent on-pitch performance. Title won? Sponsor activation fires. CL qualified? Kit deal tier unlocks. Big derby? Stadium fills. Avoid invisible income.
2. **Slow variables are inputs, not outputs.** Fan base, reputation, stadium capacity move slowly and *drive* fast variables (attendance, sponsor value). Never the other way around.
3. **Presets before sliders.** User decisions use discrete, curated options (pricing tier, accept/reject sponsor offer). Free-text numbers invite degenerate optimization and heavy balancing work.
4. **Replace, don't stack.** Where this system owns a revenue line (matchday, commercial), it **replaces** the existing formula. Revenue is never double-counted.
5. **AI parity.** Every user-facing decision has a matching AI heuristic so the league economy stays balanced across 40+ clubs. Concrete AI behaviour is specified per phase in the roadmap below.
6. **Subsidy floor stays.** The existing public-subsidy protection for struggling clubs is preserved end-to-end. The design space to shape is the ceiling, not the floor.

## End-State Vision

The mature system has four pillars layered on shared plumbing.

### Plumbing: Attendance & Fan Base

Per-match attendance replaces annualized matchday revenue. Each fixture computes a concrete attendance number from a demand curve.

**Demand curve inputs:** fan loyalty, reputation (as a secondary floor), league position, opponent quality, derby/rival flag, competition weight (CL knockout > league > cup early round), recent form, ticket pricing tier, stadium capacity cap.

**Fan loyalty** is the stadium-occupancy stat. Its storage is split across two scales to separate editorial curation from in-game math:

- **`ClubProfile.fan_loyalty`** — the curated real-world anchor on a coarse 0–10 editorial scale. 10 = iconic/cult (Athletic Club, St. Pauli, Celtic), 8 = strong (Real Madrid, Union Berlin), 5 = average (the default), 4 and below = notably low-following. Deliberately low-resolution: the number is an editorial judgment, not a measurement.
- **`TeamReputation.base_loyalty`** — the seeded anchor on the 0–100 internal scale (copied from `fan_loyalty × 10` at game start). Never moves during the game. Captures cultural identity.
- **`TeamReputation.loyalty_points`** — the current value (0–100). Starts equal to `base_loyalty` and drifts with outcomes: trophies, European nights, homegrown stars, and promotion push it up; relegation, scandals, and long-term overpricing pull it down. The finer 0–100 resolution lets small season-end nudges accumulate meaningfully. Clamped so it can't fall more than 15 points below `base_loyalty` — the "Newcastle doesn't lose its fans in the Championship" floor.

**Loyalty drives occupancy, reputation drives price.** At equal stadium sizes, a more loyal crowd creates a higher occupancy rate regardless of reputation — a Rayo Vallecano game fills a larger share of its smaller ground than a Villarreal game fills of its bigger one. Reputation still matters in two places: it sets the per-seat ticket price (an elite club's seat is worth more than a local club's), and it provides a secondary floor on the demand curve so a marquee club with crashed loyalty still draws walk-up interest.

Two emergent hooks the later phases can build on:
- **Home-xG bonus** for high-loyalty matchdays — the 12th man as a simulation input.
- **Capacity expansion is not automatically a win.** Adding seats at a low-loyalty club produces a visibly emptier stadium; expansion only pays off when loyalty is consistently pressing against capacity.

Displayed in match reports and a new Stadium page.

### Pillar 1 — Stadium (Capital, Multi-Season)

- **Capacity expansion** projects committed at season end, resolved over 1–2 seasons via a closing/setup processor. Paid in instalments. Running cost rises on completion.
- **Itemised facilities** replace the monolithic `GameInvestment.facilities_tier`. Discrete items (VIP boxes, hospitality suites, heating, big screen, fan zone, improved catering) each with specific revenue or fan-satisfaction effects. Sum replaces the current 1.0–1.6× tier multiplier.
- **Naming rights** slot, negotiated as a long-term stadium-linked sponsorship (see Pillar 3).
- **Maintenance cost** scales with capacity and facility count — real trade-off for clubs expanding faster than their competitive level can justify.

### Pillar 2 — Ticketing (Operational Policy)

- **Pricing tier** per season: 3–5 discrete tiers (Accessible / Standard / Premium / Elite) with built-in elasticity.
- **Fixture categories**: matches classified A/B/C by opponent prestige + competition; each category has its own pricing within the chosen tier.
- **Season tickets**: allocation slider (guaranteed revenue floor vs. matchday flexibility). Renewal rate tied to previous-season success.
- **Fan satisfaction**: overpricing drains fan base; fair pricing + success boosts it.

### Pillar 3 — Commercial Portfolio (Sponsor Contracts)

Replaces the `commercial_per_seat × position_growth` lump sum with negotiated, slot-based contracts.

| Slot | Unlock | Term | Structure |
|------|--------|------|-----------|
| Main shirt sponsor | All clubs | 2–4 seasons | Base + CL/title bonus |
| Kit manufacturer | All clubs | 3–5 seasons | Base + merch royalties + CL bonus |
| Sleeve sponsor | Established+ | 1–3 seasons | Base + performance bonuses |
| Training kit sponsor | Established+ | 1–3 seasons | Base |
| Stadium naming rights | Continental+ | 5–10 seasons | Large base + minor bonus |
| Official partners (N) | Scaled by fan base | 1–2 seasons | Flat base |

Offers generated in the **off-season window** — specifically in `SeasonSetupPipeline` before `BudgetProjectionProcessor`, so the new sponsor values feed the upcoming season's budget projection. User accepts, rejects, or counters. Performance bonuses trigger at season settlement from standings and competition outcomes. This is where the "performance → money" flywheel delivers its most dramatic payoffs.

### Pillar 4 — Merchandising (Integrated, Not Standalone)

Modelled as royalties on the kit manufacturer contract, scaled by fan base, marquee-player presence (future Player-module attribute), and recent competition footprint. Not a separate decision surface — the user influences merch through signings and sponsorship choices.

## Integration With Existing Systems

| System | Integration |
|--------|-------------|
| **Finance** | `BudgetProjectionService` consumes active sponsor contracts and expected attendance; `SeasonSettlementProcessor` reconciles actual attendance + triggered bonuses. Replaces `calculateMatchdayRevenue()` and `calculateCommercialRevenue()`. Subsidy floor unchanged. |
| **Season** | New processors across both pipelines. `SeasonClosingPipeline` runs the fan-base update and the stadium-construction tick (both reflect just-finished-season outcomes). `SeasonSetupPipeline` runs sponsor-offer generation before `BudgetProjectionProcessor` so new sponsor values feed the next season's budget. |
| **Match** | `MatchFinalizationService` records per-match attendance; matchday revenue becomes the sum of per-match tickets. |
| **Competition** | Performance bonuses triggered by standings + knockout outcomes. |
| **Notification** | New types: sponsor offer, bonus triggered, construction complete, fan satisfaction warning. |
| **Reputation** | Fan base is a new slow-moving club stat that complements reputation; sponsor value scales with both. |
| **Player** | Future: marquee-player attribute feeds merchandising royalties. |

## What This Replaces

- `Team.stadium_seats` / `Team.stadium_name` migrate to a new game-scoped `ClubStadium` model in Phase 5; capacity becomes mutable. (Phase 1 keeps them on `Team`.)
- `GameInvestment.facilities_tier` retired in Phase 5; itemised facilities take over the 1.0–1.6× matchday multiplier.
- `config/finances.php` `commercial_per_seat` and `commercial_growth` retired in Phase 4; sponsor-contract income takes over.
- `BudgetProjectionService::calculateMatchdayRevenue()` becomes a sum over expected match attendance.
- `BudgetProjectionService::getBaseCommercialRevenue()` becomes a sum over active sponsor contracts.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1a — Plumbing / display-only (no user decisions, no financial impact)

Goal: establish attendance and fan loyalty as first-class concepts with visible output, without adding any new decision surface or changing how revenue is calculated. If there's a bug in attendance computation, it stays cosmetic.

- New `fan_loyalty` column on `ClubProfile` (static per-club, 0–10 editorial scale). Curated real-world anchor for each club's stadium-filling power. Uncurated clubs default to 5 (the scale midpoint).
- New `base_loyalty` + `loyalty_points` columns on `TeamReputation` (game-scoped, 0–100). Mirrors the existing `base_reputation_level` / `reputation_points` pair. `base_loyalty` seeds from `ClubProfile.fan_loyalty × 10` and never moves; `loyalty_points` starts equal and is static until Phase 1b wires up the drift processor.
- New `MatchAttendance` record per fixture, computed and persisted **pre-match** (in `MatchdayOrchestrator::processBatch` before simulation) so the live-match screen can display the figure and future phases can hook atmosphere events.
- Demand curve service computing attendance from: `0.50 + (loyalty_points / 100) × 0.45` as the primary fill rate (mapping loyalty 0 → 50%, loyalty 100 → 95%), `reputation_fill_floor[tier]` as a secondary floor for elite/continental clubs, plus context modifiers for opponent reputation, competition weight, and league position. Calibrated against real La Liga / La Liga 2 / Premier League / Bundesliga / Serie A / Ligue 1 occupancy data. Capped at stadium capacity. Recent form and derby flags deferred to later phases.
- Live match screen and match reports show attendance.
- AI: no changes (deterministic curve applies equally to all clubs).
- **Revenue unchanged**: `BudgetProjectionService` and `SeasonSettlementProcessor` keep their existing flat `capacity × per-seat` formulas. Matchday revenue is not yet driven by attendance.
- **Loyalty drift inactive**: `FanLoyaltyUpdateProcessor` exists but is not wired into `SeasonClosingPipeline`. `loyalty_points` stays at its seeded value until Phase 1b.

**Deferred from original Phase 1 scope:** The dedicated `ClubStadium` model (and migrating `stadium_name`/`stadium_seats` off `Team`) is pushed to Phase 5, when capacity expansion and naming rights actually need mutable per-game stadium state. Phase 1a continues to read capacity and venue name from `Team`.

Deliverable: visible attendance in every match, foundational loyalty stat, zero regressions to gameplay or financial projections.

### Phase 1b — Financial integration (attendance drives revenue + loyalty drifts)

Goal: wire the Phase 1a plumbing into the financial model and season-end pipeline, once attendance numbers are validated in production.

- `SeasonSettlementProcessor::calculateMatchdayRevenue()` replaced by a sum over recorded `MatchAttendance` rows × current per-reputation per-seat rate. Falls back to the legacy formula if no attendance rows exist.
- `BudgetProjectionService::calculateMatchdayRevenue()` projects attendance deterministically from the same demand curve the engine uses at match time. Financial Center projections track settled reality.
- `FanLoyaltyUpdateProcessor` wired into `SeasonClosingPipeline` (priority 92, after reputation + settlement). Nudges `loyalty_points` based on season outcomes (trophies, league position, gravity).

Deliverable: matchday revenue tracks actual attendance; loyalty drifts season-to-season; the flywheel is live.

### Phase 2 — UI Skeleton (Club hub)

Goal: introduce a top-level **Club** hub in the navigation to house the non-sporting side of club management, and give the Phase 1 plumbing a visible home.

- New top-level navigation item **Club** — a shell for Finance, Stadium, Reputation, and future non-sporting club features. Replaces the current top-level **Finances** entry so the nav bar stays short on mobile.
- Move the existing **Finances** page under **Club**.
- New **Stadium** page under **Club**: capacity, fan base, last-match attendance, projected vs. actual matchday revenue. No controls yet.
- New **Reputation** page under **Club**: reputation milestones, season-over-season growth, current reputation. Visualises the existing reputation system.
- AI: no decisions (UI-only phase).

Deliverable: `Club` hub is live with three initial tenants (Finances, Stadium, Reputation); Phase 1 plumbing becomes visible to the player.

### Phase 3 — Ticketing as a decision layer

Goal: one meaningful player decision; validate elasticity and fan-satisfaction mechanics.

- Ticket-pricing policy presets (Accessible / Standard / Premium / Elite) on `ClubStadium`.
- Demand curve incorporates pricing-tier elasticity.
- Fan satisfaction effect: sustained premium pricing drains fan base; accessible pricing + success boosts it.
- Per-matchday **Día del Club** checkbox (default off) on home league fixtures. Applies a supplement on season-ticket holders, boosting matchday revenue for that match with a small attendance drop and a fan-base cost that grows with repeated use. No season cap — the compounding fan-base cost is the natural brake.
- Optional: season-ticket allocation slider.
- AI heuristic: each club picks a pricing tier based on reputation + recent form. Elite clubs default to Premium, mid-table to Standard, strugglers to Accessible. Clubs drop a tier after sustained low attendance. Día del Club has no dedicated AI behaviour — AI matchday revenue is governed by a general heuristic.
- Notifications: fan unrest warning on sustained high pricing + poor results.

Deliverable: first real player decision, first fan-base feedback loop.

### Phase 4 — Commercial portfolio (sponsor contracts)

Goal: replace lump-sum commercial revenue with negotiated contracts and performance bonuses — the heart of the flywheel.

- New `SponsorContract` model (slot type, club, base value, duration, performance clauses, status).
- `SponsorOfferGenerationProcessor` in `SeasonSetupPipeline` (before `BudgetProjectionProcessor`) creates offers scaled by reputation, fan base, and competition footprint.
- UI: contracts screen with active deals, pending offers, expiring deals.
- `BudgetProjectionService::getBaseCommercialRevenue()` replaced by a sum over active contracts.
- Performance bonuses trigger at settlement.
- AI heuristic: each club accepts the highest-value offer for every empty slot. Counters only trigger for established+ clubs with existing deals near expiry. A slot is never left empty if any offer is on the table.
- Initial slots: main shirt, kit manufacturer, stadium naming (unlocked by reputation).
- Rebalancing pass: adjust so baseline commercial income lands in the same ballpark as today's lump sum, to avoid cascading effects on wages, transfer budgets, and AI.

Deliverable: replaces commercial revenue with the most emotionally-rewarding payoff loop in the feature.

### Phase 5 — Stadium capital

Goal: long-term infrastructure strategy — the slowest, most transformative lever.

- Capacity expansion projects (committed at season end, completed after N seasons, paid in instalments). **Barcelona model**: capacity is reduced during construction rather than additive-only, making expansion a real multi-season commitment.
- Itemised facilities replacing `GameInvestment.facilities_tier`.
- Naming-rights slot on `ClubStadium` linked to Pillar-3 sponsorships (whole-stadium only, no per-stand deals).
- Maintenance cost on `operating_expenses` scales with capacity and facility count.
- UI: stadium-upgrade planner.
- AI heuristic: clubs trigger expansion when fan base consistently exceeds current capacity utilisation and budget allows. Elite clubs with 95%+ sellout rates are the most aggressive. Never expand while in financial distress.

Deliverable: multi-season progression arc.

## Design Decisions

### Resolved

- **Fan base surface**: displayed to the player as a 0–100 number.
- **Stadium expansion during construction**: Barcelona model — capacity drops during the build, not additive-only. Makes expansion a real multi-season commitment.
- **Naming rights granularity**: whole-stadium only; no per-stand / per-section deals.
- **Día del Club mechanic**: per-matchday checkbox (default off) available on every home league fixture. Ticking it applies a supplement on season-ticket holders for that match, multiplying matchday revenue at the cost of a small attendance drop (socios who skip rather than pay) and a fan-base hit. The fan-base hit grows with repeated use within a season — frequency is self-regulating, no hard season cap. Home league fixtures only (Copa and CL finals are played at neutral venues and therefore cannot be home games). This is an intentional carve-out from Principle 5 (AI parity): the mechanic is narrow enough that AI clubs don't get a dedicated heuristic — their matchday revenue is handled by a general AI heuristic instead.

### Decided later (non-blocking for the vision)

- **Phase 4 rebalancing aggressiveness.** Replacing `commercial_per_seat` cascades into wages, transfer budgets, and AI behaviour. Balancing pass during Phase 4 implementation.
- **Financial distress states** (debt, transfer bans) beyond the current subsidy floor. Revisit when/if gameplay needs a harder failure mode.
- **Marquee-player merchandising surface.** In Phase 4, merch is a flat fan-base multiplier; a proper star-power attribute on Player is deferred to a later phase.

## Implemented: Stadium Naming Mechanics (v1)

A first slice of the naming-rights pillar, shipped ahead of the broader Phase 4/5 commercial rework. It is the first concrete realisation of the **commercial revenue lever**: recurring sponsor income that feeds `projected_total_revenue` and strengthens the club budget. The lever is **proactive** — it lives on a dedicated **Commercial page** (`game.club.commercial`, in the Club hub), not in a stream of unsolicited offers — so managers can see it and act on it on their own schedule. Two levers, both gated to the **pre-season identity window** (pre-season through the first league matchday, mirroring how season-ticket pricing locks):

- **Cosmetic rename** — change the stadium name freely, once per season. No fan-support effect; pure identity. Lives on the stadium page; blocked while a naming-rights deal owns the name.
- **Naming-rights sponsorship** — the manager **seeks sponsors** on demand (`NamingRightsService::seekSponsors`): each search charges a reputation-scaled **agency fee** (drawn from the transfer budget, like a cash stadium purchase) and a **cooldown** (`commercial.naming_rights.search_fee` / `search_cooldown_days`), then tops the offer board up to `max_pending_offers` with fresh, reputation-weighted offers (1–5 season terms). The headline value and the candidate brands are both tier-gated: the annual figure is drawn from the club's reputation band (`commercial.naming_rights.annual_value`, ≈€50K/yr local up to ≈€30M/yr elite, calibrated to real naming-rights deals), and the sponsor is drawn from a real-brand pool gated on two axes (`commercial.naming_rights.sponsors`): **reach** must bid for the club's tier (`sponsor_reach_by_tier`) and, for non-global brands, **country** must match the club's league — a national/regional brand only operates in its home market, while global brands (Emirates, Coca-Cola) name grounds anywhere. So a Spanish third-tier ground gets a Spanish regional backer, not a global airline or a foreign supermarket. Each playable league (ES/EN/DE/FR/IT) carries its own national + regional brands; the global pool is shared. Accepting one pays a **fixed recurring annual fee** and inflicts a **one-time fan-loyalty shock** at signing, scaled by `base_loyalty` (cult clubs pay most). The shock respects the existing `base_loyalty − 15` loyalty floor, so it's sharp but recovers through results. The fee + cooldown are the friction that keeps recurring income from becoming free money on tap.

Each offer card surfaces the **annual fee** and **contract length** — a single fixed figure the manager weighs against the fan-support cost.

**The trade-off:** the income is a known, fixed cheque, but signing costs a one-time loyalty shock that lowers the demand-curve fill rate → lower attendance → smaller gate revenue. The naming fee itself does not move with attendance.

**Income math** lives in `NamingRightsService` (Stadium module), so Finance and Season call into Stadium, preserving dependency direction:
- *Projected* = the deal's fixed `annual_value`, folded into commercial-adjacent revenue by `BudgetProjectionService`.
- *Settled* = the same fixed `annual_value`, by `SeasonSettlementProcessor`. Projection and settlement agree exactly — no attendance variance.

**Game-scoped name:** the in-game name lives on `game_stadiums.stadium_name` (set by rename or active deal), resolved by `GameStadiumNameResolver` (mirrors `StadiumCapacityResolver`) and surfaced through `GameMatch::venueName()`. `Team.stadium_name` remains the fallback. `GenerateNamingRightsOffersProcessor` (priority 105, before budget projection) rolls deals over each pre-season — expiring ended deals, handing the name back, and dropping a one-off "commercial window open" notification that deep-links to the Commercial page. It does **not** mint offers; the manager seeks them.
